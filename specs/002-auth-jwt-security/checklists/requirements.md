# Specification Quality Checklist: Authentication & JWT Security Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`.
- Scope explicitly excludes OAuth, social login, refresh token rotation, RBAC, password reset, and email verification per user constraints.
- The spec uses technology-agnostic language: "signed token" instead of "JWT", "authentication library" instead of "Better Auth" — technology choices belong in the plan, not the spec.
- US3 (Access Protected API) is the critical integration point that bridges this feature with the existing Task CRUD API (feature 001).
